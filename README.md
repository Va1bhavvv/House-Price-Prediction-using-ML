Built a machine learning-based system to estimate property prices in Bengaluru, enabling users to predict the cost of apartments or houses by entering specific location and property details. The project involved extensive data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature engineering to enhance model accuracy. Applied multiple regression algorithms—including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressor—and selected the best-performing model based on RMSE and R² metrics. Integrated a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions, allowing users to input parameters such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. This project demonstrates practical implementation of supervised learning for real estate applications and provides valuable insights for property buyers and investors.

This project focuses on predicting residential property prices in Bengaluru using machine learning. The dataset includes various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and availability status. The raw data initially contained inconsistencies, missing values, and categorical variables, which were systematically preprocessed through techniques such as one-hot encoding, dimensionality reduction, and normalization.

A custom data pipeline was built to handle data transformation and filtering, especially for high-cardinality features like location. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover underlying patterns, regional price trends, and feature correlations.

After preprocessing, several regression models were trained and compared, including Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressors. Cross-validation was used to fine-tune hyperparameters and ensure generalizability. The final model achieved high predictive accuracy on unseen data and was integrated with a simple UI using Python libraries like Streamlit, allowing users to enter property features and get instant price estimates.
